## My Workflow

The goal is to split tasks based on type. And then focus to get that task done.

### 1. Content and wireframe

What content to display how to organize the pages, and where the content goes. Using figma, and naming the frames as React Components.

### 2. Design

Build upon the wireframe and add design elements, choose colors, images, backgrounds. Design basic reusable elements like button, header, text. Then create the individual sections.

### 3. Tech-Stack selection

Notice the website is already prepared. The **"what"** is clear at this point. Now let's start with the **"how"**. I picked nextjs for it's simple setup with pages and lot of features. It's the React framework. For the styling library i went with tailwind.

### 4. Coding

Initialize git repository, setup package json, work on readme file and content. Slowly add folders and files.
